                  Resident Evil 4 or Re4 stars Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil 2, who is now an agent for the U.S. government, rescuing the President's daughter, Ashley Graham. 
                  Resident Evil has always been one of Capcom's most popular and best selling franchises within the company.
                  And Re4, is no exception. 
                  To, some Re4 is the best game within its franchise, to others it's one of the best horror games.
                  And to go even further, it's crowned as one of the best video games of all time. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="bg-dark-grey">
                  However the Resident Evil 4 that is praised by many wasn't always going to be this. 
                  As far as we know with Re4, ironically, the game has had 4 different builds over the 6 year period of its development. 
                  One going to spawn its own franchise within the Capcom's library of games, and another going to fascinate fans by its dark and gritty atmosphere. 
                  Now let us go ahead and dive into these builds of the game

                  This build of the game was what come from the mind of Hideki Kamiya, the director of the game. 
                  Kamiya wanted Re4 to have action unlike the past 3 games. 
                  This build was going to star Tony Redgrave, a seemingly invincible man with superhuman abilities. 
                  However, the issue with this build of the game is that it was too cool and too stylish for Resident Evil. 
                  But Shinji Mikami, the overseer of the game, didn't think this build was bad.
                  And instead of scrapping the build, it was remade into its own game called Devil May Cry.

                <p class="bg-red">
                  Devil May Cry or DMC now starred Dante, the son of the demon king Sparda, who is looking for info on the man who killed his mother. 
                  And instead of fighting zombies, he now fends off hordes of demons, and battles with various weapons in different styles.

                  The video above shows the other two builds of Re4. 
                  The first being what some called the "fog" build of the game. 
                  This version was handled by a different director, Hrioshi Shibata.
                  In this build, Leon Kennedy is seen inflitrating Umbrella's secert headquartes using some mysterious power in his hand. 
                  Shibata's build, while visually impressive for the time, lacked what Capcom wanted the game to be.

                <p>
                  The next part in the video shows what people refer to as the "hallucination" build.
                  This time putting Leon in an abandoned house fighting off what seems to be haunted dolls and spirts.
